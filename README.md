**MoniGo** is a performance monitoring library for Go applications. It provides real-time insights into application performance with an intuitive user interface, enabling developers to track and optimize both service-level and function-level metrics.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Access up-to-date performance metrics for your Go applications.
- **Detailed Insights**: Track and analyze both service and function-level performance.
- **Customizable Dashboard**: Manage performance data with an easy-to-use UI.
- **Visualizations**: Utilize graphs and charts to interpret performance trends.

## Installation

To install MoniGo, use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/iyashjayesh/monigo
```

#### For Linux

Install Graphviz:

```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

Or, if you use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install graphviz
```

#### For Windows

1. Download Graphviz from the following link: https://graphviz.gitlab.io/_pages/Download/Download_windows.html
2. Install Graphviz and set the path in the environment variables.

## Usage

To begin monitoring your Go application, import the monigo package and call the monigo.Start function:

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/iyashjayesh/monigo"
)

func main() {

    monigoInstance := &monigo.Monigo{
		ServiceName:   "service_name", // Default service name is "service_name"
		DashboardPort: 8080, // Default port is 8080
	}

	monigoInstance.PurgeMonigoStorage()
	monigoInstance.SetDbSyncFrequency("1m") // Default is 5m
	monigoInstance.StartDashboard()

    select {} // To keep the program running
}
```

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation.

By default, the dashboard will be available at http://localhost:8080/.

You can access the dashboard by visiting the following URL: http://localhost:8080/

Reports need to be generated by the user by clicking on the "Generate Report" button on the Reports page.

## Bellow Reports are available:

1. **Load Statistics**: Provides an overview of the overall load of the service, CPU load, memory load, and system load.

| Field Name                | Value (Datatype) |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `overall_load_of_service` | `float64`        |
| `service_cpu_load`        | `float64`        |
| `service_memory_load`     | `float64`        |
| `system_cpu_load`         | `float64`        |
| `system_memory_load`      | `float64`        |

2. **CPU Statistics**: Displays the total number of cores, cores used by the service, and cores used by the system.

| Field Name              | Value (Datatype) |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| `total_cores`           | `int`            |
| `cores_used_by_service` | `int`            |
| `cores_used_by_system`  | `int`            |

3. **Memory Statistics**: Shows the total system memory, memory used by the system, memory used by the service, available memory, GC pause duration, and stack memory usage.

| Field Name               | Value (Datatype) |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `total_system_memory`    | `float64`        |
| `memory_used_by_system`  | `float64`        |
| `memory_used_by_service` | `float64`        |
| `available_memory`       | `float64`        |
| `gc_pause_duration`      | `float64`        |
| `stack_memory_usage`     | `float64`        |

4. **Memory Profile**: Provides information on heap allocation by the service, heap allocation by the system, total allocation by the service, and total memory by the OS.

| Field Name               | Value (Datatype) |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `heap_alloc_by_service`  | `float64`        |
| `heap_alloc_by_system`   | `float64`        |
| `total_alloc_by_service` | `float64`        |
| `total_memory_by_os`     | `float64`        |

5. **Network IO**: Displays the number of bytes sent and received.

| Field Name       | Value (Datatype) |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `bytes_sent`     | `float64`        |
| `bytes_received` | `float64`        |

6. **Overall Health**: Provides an overall health percentage for the service.

| Field Name               | Value (Datatype) |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `overall_health_percent` | `float64`        |
